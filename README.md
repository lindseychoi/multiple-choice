Multiple choice quiz for DU bootcamp homework

For this assignment, I created a multiple choice quiz that was timed, took in the score through the timer, and gives the user the score at the end of the quiz. At the end of the quiz, the user inputs their initials and a scores list populates to show the scores from local storage.
